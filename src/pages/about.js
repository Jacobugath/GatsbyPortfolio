    <p>
    Based in Eagle Mountain, UT, I am passionate about web development and collaborative work. I started creating websites for fun on my own, and soon sought to make it a career. As a recent graduate of the University of Utahâ€™s Coding Bootcamp (2019), I am versatile in a number of languages and libraries, particularly JavaScript and React. With a growth-based mindset and a desire to keep learning, I know how to solve problems patiently by adapting new approaches to specific scenarios.</p>
    <p>
Web development requires a combination of technical knowledge, communication skills, and creativity. I excel at all of them. Strategic leadership and mediation are two of the skills that make me a prized addition to any team.</p>
